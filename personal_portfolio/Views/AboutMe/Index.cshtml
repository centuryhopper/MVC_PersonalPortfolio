    <p>
    I am a passionate software guy trying to live his best life. I have both a bachelor's and a master's in computer science from the University of Central Florida. I currently work as a .Net developer at FWC (Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission) using Model-View-Controller design pattern (MVC), SQL server, entity framework, and Azure Devops as the source control. My productive spare-time hobbies include creating full-stack development on web, mobile, and game applications. I also like traveling, exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and trying different foods.
